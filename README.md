## Overview

This is a simple code snippet showing how to use the FB_JsonDomParser with path. There is no TwinCAT solution for this, only the snippet below.

## Getting Started

Start a new TwinCAT project and be sure to add the TC3_JsonXml library. Copy and paste the code below in to your main program.

```
PROGRAM MAIN
VAR
	// remember to make a string large enough to hold the json.
	jsonString : T_MAXSTRING :=
		'[
			  {
				"First": 4
			  },
			  {
				"Second": 12,
				"Third": [100, 200, 300],
				"Fourth": {
				  "a": true
				}
			  }
			]';

	triggered : BOOL;
	jsonParser : FB_JsonDomParser;
	jsonDocument : SJsonValue;
	jsonProperty : SJsonValue;
	value : DINT;
END_VAR

//

IF NOT triggered THEN
	jsonDocument := jsonParser.ParseDocument(jsonString);
	jsonProperty := jsonParser.FindMemberPath(jsonDocument, '#1/Third#2');
	value := jsonParser.GetInt(jsonProperty); // value = 300 (as arrays are zero indexed);
	triggered := TRUE;
END_IF
```
